#### Di Ku, ***Musical lyric sentiment analyst***
Someday, I wake up and think if was possible that lyrics of songs could have "sentiment". The problem is that lyric are only one element of all the music and more of type this could be incomplete or grammatical incorrect. But, ¡I wanted to test something!

For that proyect I used API ``Stanford CoreNLP``. I known that API because I used to my final proyect degree. This API have a lot of functionalities about PLN and I used ``Sentiment Analyst`` functionality to analyst lyrics of songs.

First, I added songs manually but after, I decided integrate my application with real API. ¡This was a huge problem! Any API gave me the lyric of their songs, maybe, this is the principal core of their business. I don't kwnow really but after an initial disappointment it ocurred to me use another method. ``API Genius`` not really gave me their lyrics but yes the url of the htlm that contains lyrics. So, this was my oportunity to do ``web scrapping``. Really, I think I hadn't done scraping never so this was a good oportunity for me. I found some interesting API for Java ``Java JSOUP`` so I started working. 

In this moment, I have project in progress and they gave me some results, for the moment, it seems, all songs are very neutral or ambiguos for PLN but I need more analyst for confirm that.
